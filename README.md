# Reviews Chrome Extension
Chrome extension that shows reviews for a restaurant/food spot, from multiple source (Google Maps, Yelp, DoorDash, etc.), when you are on one of these pages.

## Story
Whenever I was on Doordash, I wanted to check the reviews for a restaurant on Yelp or Google Maps. It is a tedious process to open a new tab, search for the restaurant, and then check the reviews. I wanted to make this process easier, so I created this Chrome extension.

## Roadmap
Start with Doordash, then add more sources.
