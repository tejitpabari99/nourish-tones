# Nourish Tones

Chrome/Edge Extension that highlights items in doordash menu based on the dietary restriction (Vegetarian, Vegetarian (No Egg), Vegan, Pescatarian). Can also add custom dietary restrictions (allergies) to highlight them as red.

## Motivation
I am a vegetarian and I have to go scroll through a huge menu to find items that are vegetarian. Hence, I made an extension to help with it

## Implementation
I look through the title and description of the item and regex match it with the words in each category. If it matches, I highlight the item. Slight optimization in categorizing.

## Future Work
Couple of ideas for the future
- Switch to AI based model to categorize the items
- Add support for other platforms (Uber Eats)
- See most popular veg items on top
